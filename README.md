[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/752b577f704f463f76358ac3633c483d1e788aab00963d87e0.svg)](https://buildkite.com/panoptix/hotrod-oss)

HotRod is an opinionated 'Platform' for analytics. It contains the building blocks and automation to enable running logging as a PaaS.

It is under heavy development, please contact support@panoptix.co.za for assistance.

### Getting Started

- Install docker-machine (see [https://docs.docker.com/machine/](https://docs.docker.com/machine/#installation))

- Install docker-compose (see [https://docs.docker.com/compose/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose))

- Install Panoptix Mini Templates

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/panoptix-za/mini-templates.git
  sudo cp mini-templates/mini.py /usr/local/bin
  ```

- Install HotRod

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/panoptix-za/HotRod.git
  cd HotRod
  ```

- Create a docker-machine based server

  Replace `my_api_token` and `ams3` as appropriate below.

  ```
  export DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=my_api_token
  export DIGITALOCEAN_REGION=ams3
  ./bin/do_machine.sh create myhotrodserver Hotrod
  ```

  To view your machine run:

  ```
  docker-machine ls
  ```

  This will create a server with the default project named `Hotrod`. The project should be unique for each Hotrod instance.

- run `./hotrod init` and follow the prompts

### Do something custom

There is a special folder called `local`. Add you docker-compose files there to your hearts content. Look at the dc-elk.yml.orig.tpl file for examples. The labels, etc should be used too.

### Features

 - If you place 'once' in the name of the dc-*.yml file (Docker Compose) then it will only be executed once.

### Components

- Docker
- Weave
- Elasticsearch
- Rsyslog
- Kibana
